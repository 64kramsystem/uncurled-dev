# Expect this

Open Source means working in the open with people from all over. Humans from
all places and positions in life. From different continents, cultures, ages,
religions, languages, time zones and keyboard layouts. You can expect some of
those to act and speak in surprising ways, but you can also get new unexpected
friends that will take the Open Source project to new levels.
