# Maintain

A "maintainer" is someone who maintains, develops and looks after an Open
Source project.

In a large project, there can be numerous different roles with different
people assigned to them. In smaller projects, there are often just a small set
of people that do everything that needs to be done in an Open Source project.

An projects needs so much more than just code to strive and succeed.
