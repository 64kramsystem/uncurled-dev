# We are all differently privileged

Some of us have a job that takes a lot of time and energy that makes it hard
to work on Open Source. Having many kids or family members that need help or
assistance can take up a lot of your days. Being a family provider, putting
food on the table and doing the laundry can take a lot of time.

Having been born in a rich and well functioning part of the world is a luxury
and a factor that is hard to change yourself. A privilege no doubt.

In some businesses it is common for employers to ban employees from doing Open
Source in their spare time.

We must acknowledge that everyone's ability to spend time and energy on Open
Source is unique to each and everyone and the situation may vary greatly from
person to person. It can be a decision to not spend more than N hours per week
on Open Source, but it can also just be an economic reality that prevents
someone else from participating at all.
