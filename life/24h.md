# Days are 24 hours for all of us

How do you get time to spend on Open Source?

Everyone has equally many hours per day to work with. It is what we do with
those hours that count.

Some of us take longer than others to write code or to come up with solutions
to problems.

Some of us spend hours of the day on other things than Open Source. It may be
computer games, socializing with friends, hobbies or sleeping in.

When people ask me how I get time to work on Open Source I usually answer that
I do less of everything else: less sleep, no computer games, less TV and to
some extent I sacrifize social life. Yet I have a family, tgwo kids and I
maintain a life. I will not claim I master this, but I think I manage all
right.
