# Security problems will appear

Security is hard and flaws easily creep in. Be humble and prepared to act when
(not if) such problems are reported. Also, be prepared that changes you
thought nobody cared about or used will get some serious attention and get
flamed badly once a security flaw is pointed out and gets handled by the
public. This is not saying that you cannot have processes and develop code to
be more secure than others. You can and you should.

We judge projects based on how they handle their security problems, not by
their existence.

We *never* compare projects by counting published past security
vulnerabilities. It does not work. A project having reported more issues might
have had more scrutiny or just set the bar lower than the project with fewer.
