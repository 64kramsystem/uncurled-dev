# Write documentation

As a maintainer of a project, you are one of the people who knows a lot, maybe
most, of the internals workings of the code. That helps when aswering
questions and even more when... the documenting the project.

Documention is of course there to describe how your product or service works,
and to cover as many details as possible so that users and developers can find
answers to their problems by reading there rather than asking questions that
takes time for other humans to respond to.

By extending and polishing the documention, you ideally set yourself up and
offload work from your future self from questions.

Providing clear and accurate documentation is hard and I have learned that you
can spend a lot of time on that. What you think is a clear description might
not read well in others' minds.

Documentation also needs to be easy to find (in) and it needs to be presented
in a tasteful or maybe even attractive way.

I always end up spending a large amount of my time writing documentation.
