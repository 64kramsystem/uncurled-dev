# Do not accept undocumented code

Do not accept badly documented or badly tested code into the project.
Sometimes it is tempting when the feature is nice and something you have been
wanting for a long while but have not yet been able to do yourself.
You. Must. Resist. It will haunt you and bounce back at you in the future and
bite.
