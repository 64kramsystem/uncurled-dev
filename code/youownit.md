# Once merged, you own it

If you merge someone's incomplete patch because it shows progress and is in
the right spirit, be prepared to finish off all the other details yourself
since the merge is often seen as the final station for contributors. You need
to reject and ask for improvements before the code goes in to make sure the
contributor stays willing to work on and polish the code.
