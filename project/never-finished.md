# It is never finished

This is hardly any surprise to anyone, but projects in general tend to never
really get finished and I imagine that Open Source projects in particular
never do as long as there is a certain amount of users. There are always bug
fixes to be made and people will always want to add more tweaks or features
and then we get more bugs and repeat.

Projects typically finish when there are no more users (willing to work on it).

For individual authors and maintainers, the work on a project can of course
end when they decide to just stop participating in that project.
