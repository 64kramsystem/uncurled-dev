# The world is full of projects

Do not expect contributors and team members to flock around your awesome
idea. In fact, if you just deliver decently good stuff, chances are you may
remain relatively alone in the project. Work to aid people to get into the
project and ease every step, but do not expect them to come.

Your Open Source project competes with all other projects for the time and
skill of contributors, as there is only a finite number of contributors out
there.

Those possible contributors have a finite amount of time to spend on Open
Source, and their time is also itself shared and competes for attention with
other services such as video streaming, social media and computer games.
