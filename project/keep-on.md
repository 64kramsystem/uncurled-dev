# Keep. On. Improving.

Success is almost never instant. You should be prepared to find that you might
need to work on and polish your project for a long time before people out
there starts to understand its greatness. Of course, there is also a risk that
they never will.

A recognized and much appreciated quality in any software is longevity. With
age comes a proof that you know how to endure time and persist. That the
project is maintained in a decent way and that after this amount o time no
major disaster has been found.

With time, other people have also tested your project and there will be
reviews and opinions about it online to find and learn from. Not everyone
wants to be the first in line to try out a new project

Persistence is a golden virtue in Open Source. If you manage to hold out and
keep working, fix the bugs and add the features people seem to want then
chances are that your project finds its place and its users.
