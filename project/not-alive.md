# If not alive, it is dead

An Open Source project that does not update its web site or other resources
within a given time period will appear dead. A project that appears dead are
not updated for reason: because people in the project do not care enough. If
people do not care enough to keep things up-to-date, the project is dead. Yes
sure there are exceptions, but not many... We all look at other projects like
this, we better realize that others look at our projects the same way!
