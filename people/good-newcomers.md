# Newcomers can be awesome

There are lots of clever people in the world. A person who never previously
contributed before in your project can be really bright, smart and write
incredible code that pushes your team forward already in their first
contributions. When responding to questions and providing review comments on
changes, remember that new in the project does not necessarily imply rookie in
any other sense.

Sometimes you get the best patches and help from people you never met before
and who moves on the next day never to come back. The open-source community
can be a warm and fuzzy place!
