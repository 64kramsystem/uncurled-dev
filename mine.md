# My experiences

I have participated *deeply* and *properly* in several Open Source projects
and in this section I will describe some of those projects. How I got into the
projects, some of the specifics of the projects, my position in the project
and perhaps something I learned from that particular one.

This is not meant to be an exhaustive or complete list.
